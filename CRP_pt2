CSSOM

angle brakets are for HTML

tokens to nodes
body, p, span, img etc - those are the tokens
font-size, font-weight. float, etc - those are nodes

children of body node get their node characteristics

More specific tags are more expensive since it has to traverse more nodes in the DOM treets

Measure first - optimize second

'Recalculate Style' step - changes CSS response to CSS DOM


DOM - content of page
CSSDOM - styles of the page

Render Tree
 - only captures visible content and styles
 - start at root of DOM tree
 	- do any CSS rules match with it
 	- if yes - and they should be shown (so not displany:none), copy node to Render Tree
 	- if the CSS rule says it shouldn't be displayed this also trickles down to the children of the token


Layout
- set <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width"

We care about the 'Rendering' parts

When we update the layer tree - we cause the computer to run the entire thing all over again

Batch updates to optimize sites

Painting also requires updating the render tree

1. Parsing constructing the DOM
	- this happens asynchronus since you can parse at you get it, can be incremental and reponse may not come all at once, may not construct it all at once
2. Request CSS & JS resources
    - script is synchronous so can't implement it until we have an CSSOM, completing the CSSOM unblocks the Javascript engine and allows us to use it
    - once Javascript engie is unblocked it will implement it and then continue to the DOM construction
3. Parse CSS and construct CSSOM tree
4. Execute JS
5. Merge DOM and CSSOM into the Render Tree
6. Run layout, paint
