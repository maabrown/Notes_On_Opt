Critial Rendering Path - the sequence of steps the browser uses to render your page

Sequence of steps web browser uses to change HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to pixels on the screen

Characters/HTML response -> Tokens -> Nodes -> DOM

angle brackets signal tags
tags are converted to tokens
tokens are convereted to nodes

<html> --> StartTag: html --> html node

StartTag tokens determine if an object is a child of something

Consuming all the tokens results in the creation of the DOM (tree structure that captures the content and properties of the HTML and relationship between the nodes)

Browsers build the page incrementally

Google search uses the header of the page
	- Requests page and GETS html
	- After getting HTML it builds the page head
	- Builds DOM and renders
	- After building the DOM and rendering the page head it moves to the seach results
	- Builds the DOM and renders the search results on teh age
Incremental HTML delivery
